## Privacy promise (No‑Storage)
- Your inputs are processed **in memory for this session only**.
- We **do not store** your conversation text or health/personal details.
- We keep only **non-identifying usage metrics** (e.g., which questions were answered, drop-off, which recommendation was clicked) to improve question order. Metrics are retained for a short period (e.g., ≤7 days).

## Health data (optional)
If you choose to share health-related information, it is used **only for this session** and requires your **explicit consent**. You can proceed without sharing health data.
